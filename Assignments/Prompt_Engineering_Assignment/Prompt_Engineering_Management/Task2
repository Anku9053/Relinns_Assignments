<!-- Question -1 

Task
Let’s dive into some practical examples tailored to each of your roles: software developer, designer, project manager, and QA engineer. These examples will showcase how to craft prompts that guide the AI to generate useful and specific outputs.

For Software Developers
Objective: Generate a code snippet for a specific functionality.

Scenario: You need to create a REST API endpoint in Node.js that retrieves user data by ID.

Prompt:

"Write a Node.js function for a REST API endpoint that accepts a user ID as a parameter and retrieves the corresponding user details from a MongoDB database. The function should handle errors gracefully and return the user data in JSON format."

Explanation: This prompt is clear and specific, detailing the technology stack (Node.js, MongoDB), the functionality (retrieve user data), and the expected output format (JSON). It also includes error handling, which is a critical aspect of real-world coding.


-->

Here's a Node.js function using the Express framework to create a REST API endpoint that retrieves user details from a MongoDB database based on the user ID provided as a parameter. This function assumes you are using Mongoose to interact with MongoDB.

First, make sure you have the necessary setup:

Install Mongoose: If you haven't already, you need to install Mongoose in your project:

bash
Copy code
npm install mongoose
Set up Mongoose and connect to MongoDB: Ensure you have connected Mongoose to your MongoDB database in your application. Here's a simple example:

javascript
Copy code
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/yourDatabaseName', {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
});

const db = mongoose.connection;
db.on('error', console.error.bind(console, 'connection error:'));
db.once('open', function () {
  console.log('Connected to the database');
});
Define a User Schema and Model: Assuming your user data is stored in a collection called users, define a Mongoose schema and model for it:

javascript
Copy code
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  firstName: String,
  lastName: String,
  email: String,
  // Add other fields as per your requirements
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
Now, here's the function for the REST API endpoint:

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Assuming User model is defined as shown above
const User = require('./models/User'); // Adjust the path as needed

// Define the endpoint to get user details by ID
app.get('/api/users/:userId', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { userId } = req.params;

    // Validate user ID format (optional, depending on your requirements)
    if (!mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid(userId)) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid user ID format' });
    }

    // Find the user by ID
    const user = await User.findById(userId);

    if (!user) {
      return res.status(404).json({ error: 'User not found' });
    }

    // Return user data in JSON format
    return res.json(user);
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors gracefully
    console.error('Error retrieving user:', error);
    return res.status(500).json({ error: 'An error occurred while retrieving the user' });
  }
});

// Start the server
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
Key Points:
Error Handling: The function handles errors by returning appropriate HTTP status codes and messages, such as 400 for bad requests, 404 for not found, and 500 for server errors.
Validation: There's an optional validation step for the user ID to check if it's a valid MongoDB ObjectId. This can be adjusted based on your specific needs.
Async/Await: The function uses async/await for handling asynchronous operations, making the code cleaner and easier to read.
Express Framework: This example uses Express.js to handle HTTP requests and responses. Ensure your Express app is set up properly in your project.






<!-- Question 2 


For Designers
Objective: Design a user interface component.

Scenario: You need to design a login form for a mobile app that is both aesthetic and user-friendly.

Prompt:

"Design a clean and modern login form for a mobile app. Include email and password fields, a ‘Remember Me’ checkbox, and a ‘Login’ button. Use a soothing color palette and ensure the form is easy to use on small screens."

Explanation: The prompt specifies the elements to include in the design and emphasizes usability on small screens, which is crucial for mobile design. The request for a "soothing color palette" guides the aesthetic direction.
